*Melodi:Cielito Lindo*

Ay, yi, yi, yi! Your mother swims after troop ships.  
Now, sing me another verse that’s worse than the other verse  
*[alt: “Now, sing me a chorus, I’ll rub your clitoris.”]*  
And waltz me around again, Willie!  
*[alt: “And waltz me around on your willie!”]*

There once was a man from Beirut  
Who had several warts on his root.  
He put acid on these and now, when he pees,  
He holds the damn thing like a flute!

Ay, yi, yi, yi! Your sister does squat-thrusts on flagpoles.  
Now, sing me another verse that’s worse than the other verse  
And waltz me around again, Willie!

There once was a man from Nantucket  
Whose c— was so long, he could suck it.  
He said with a grin as he wiped off his chin,  
«If this were a c—, I could f— it!»

Ay, yi, yi, yi! Your grandmother works on a corner.  
Now, sing me another verse that’s worse than the other verse  
And waltz me around again, Willie!

### Oscar Brand “Limericks” version:

There once was a poet from McNameter  
Whose mistress kept calling him amateur.  
She said, “Your technique is too rough & antique  
And your rhythm’s iambic pentameter!”

Ay, yi, yi, yi! In China, they do it for chili.  
So, Here comes another verse that’s worse than the other verse  
So, waltz me around again, Willie!

There once was a girl from St. Paul  
Wore a newspaper out to a ball.  
There came a great fire, which burned her attire  
The front page, sports section and all.

CHORUS

A hermit who lived in Belgrave  
Kept a dead prostitute in his cave  
Says he, “I’ll admit I’m a bit of a nit,  
But think of the money I save!”

CHORUS

There once was a maiden name Myrtle  
Who amused herself with a sea turtle.  
And what was phenomenal, her swelling abdominal  
Revealed that the turtle was fertile!

CHORUS

A newsboy from London named Grimes  
Lured maids onto infamous crimes.  
“I delivered” he’d boast “Two Globes and a Post.  
And Goodness knows how many Times!”

CHORUS

A very coy girl from Siam  
Remarked to her boyfriend to try-am.  
“To undress me, of course, you might have to use force  
But the Lord knows you’re stronger than I am!”

CHORUS

There was a maid married at Chester.  
Her mother first cried and then blessed her.  
She said, “What a joy! He’s a wonderful boy!  
I’ve had him myself down in Leicester!”

CHORUS

There once was a maitre d’Hotel  
Who said, “My guests can all go to Hell.  
What they do to my wife is the bane of my life!  
The worst is: they do it so well!”

Ay, yi, yi, yi! In China, they do it for chili.  
We haven’t another verse that worse than the other verse  
So, waltz me ar
