# Tekst

_Tekst: Poxy Boggards_

'Tis half past three and the chill is gone  
It's the longest binge I've ever been on  
Had so many pints, my mind's stupefied  
But through all the haze I still hear the cry!  

_Refr:_ Drink, motherfucker, drink, motherfucker, drink!  
A curse to you lads, a curse on your head,  
Drinking pint after pint until I am dead  
I just keep drinking and I don't know why,  
But tonight is the night that I drink 'til I die!  

It's quarter to five and I'm still going strong  
Is this the only place I truly belong?  
To make it all end I the good Lord beseech,  
Lying on the floor with my drink out of reach!   

_Refr:_ Drink, motherfucker, drink, motherfucker, drink!  
A curse to you lads, a curse on your head,  
Drinking pint after pint until I am dead  
I just keep drinking and I don't know why,  
But tonight is the night that I drink 'til I die!  

'Tis six in the morning, can't remember my name,  
I see all those faces - they all look the same  
And the puke on the floor makes a terrible stink,  
What is this demon that makes me want to drink!  

_Refr:_ Drink, motherfucker, drink, motherfucker, drink!  
A curse to you lads, a curse on your head,  
Drinking pint after pint until I am dead  
I just keep drinking and I don't know why,  
But tonight is the night that I drink 'til I die!  

(Drink, motherfucker, drink, motherfucker, drink!  
Drink, motherfucker....)  

_Refr:_ Drink, motherfucker, drink, motherfucker, drink!  
A curse to you lads, a curse on your head,  
Drinking pint after pint until I am dead  
I just keep drinking and I don't know why,  
But tonight is the night that I drink 'til I die!  

It's now almost noon and the spinning has stopped  
There'll be no more drink, to the floor I do drop  
And there's Ol' Nick offering eternal pain,  
He smiles as he sings this infernal refrain:  

_Refr:_ Drink, motherfucker, drink, motherfucker, drink!  
A curse to you lads, a curse on your head,  
Drinking pint after pint until I am dead  
I just keep drinking and I don't know why,  
But tonight is the night that I drink 'til I die!  

A curse to you lad, a curse on your head,  
Drinking pint after pint until I am dead  
I just keep drinking and I don't know why,  
But tonight is the night that I drink 'til I die!   

DRINK, MOTHERFUCKER, DRINK, MOTHERFUCKER, DRINK!!!
